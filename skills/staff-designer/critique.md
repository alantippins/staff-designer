# Critique Methodology

Surface interface quality concerns. Works on anything: code, screenshots, specs, plans.

**Reference files:**

- [checklists.md](references/checklists.md) — Technical checks (states, accessibility, visual coherence, mobile, red flags)
- [interaction.md](references/interaction.md) — Principles of Interface Quality

## Detect Input Type

**Artifact** (code, screenshot) → Critique what exists. Output: findings, opportunities.

**Spec/Plan** (feature description, Claude Code plan, PRD, user story) → Surface what's unaddressed. Output: questions, gaps.

The principles and lenses apply to both. The output format adapts.

Calibrate length to input. The full format applies to full artifacts. A screen, a flow, a page. For a single component or a narrow question ("thoughts on this button?"), collapse to what's useful: First Impressions + relevant lens + Top Opportunity. The structure scales down. A 1500-word critique on a 200-pixel button is its own kind of bad design.

---

## Input Modes

**Screenshot:** View the image, critique what you see.

**Code:** Read files, mentally render the interface. Focus on what's inferrable: structure, spacing, color, typography, hierarchy, component organization, interaction patterns.

**Both:** Cross-reference — "code does X but visually Y"

**Spec/Plan:** Read the description, surface interaction concerns that haven't been addressed.

## Critique Process

### Step 0: Context & Emotional Lens

Before critiquing:

- **What stage is this?** Rough exploration, working mockup, or production-close? Calibrate depth — type scale on a wireframe is wasted breath.
- **What is this?** — App type, screen purpose, target user.
- **What job is this interface hired to do?** — What outcome is the user seeking? What progress are they trying to make? (Not feature, but outcome.)
- **What state is the user likely in?** — Describe the user's posture in one sentence. Rushed, bored, anxious, skimming, committing — say it like a person would.
- **What does getting this wrong cost?** — Dollars, time, trust, safety, reputation. Name the cost explicitly; every finding below should respect it.

**Carry this through:** Every finding considers whether the interface respects or ignores the user's likely state, whether it enables the job they came to do, and whether the cost of getting it wrong is legible in the interface.

**Confirm what the screen can't show you:**

Static screens lie by omission. Before making factual claims about behavior, confirm these with the caller — or default to conditional framing if you can't:

- Is there a defined brand color or design token system? (Prevents false "color fragmentation" findings.)
- Does this autosave or preserve state across navigation? (Prevents false "no save" findings.)
- Are there keyboard shortcuts, gestures, or interactions not visible here? (Prevents false "no escape" findings.)
- What's not on this screen that's part of the flow? (Prevents false "dead end" findings.)

If answers unknown: hedge. *"If this doesn't autosave, that's a Persistence gap"* lands; *"This doesn't autosave"* overclaims.

### Step 1: First Impressions

One paragraph. Gut reaction. What's the immediate emotional response this creates? Does it feel overwhelming, uncertain, confident, cluttered, calm? What stands out? What feels off? Be direct.

## The Lenses

These are ways of seeing, not boxes to check. Hold each lens up to the interface and notice what it reveals. Not every lens applies to every interface — use judgment.

### General

Start with the basics. Is every element earning its place? Anything that doesn't serve the user's goal is stealing attention from what does. Look for paper cuts — the small irritations that compound: empty space while loading, inconsistent hover states, missing placeholders, spacing that shifts between screens. Then stress-test mentally: what happens with twice the content? Half the content? Longer names? The edge cases reveal whether this was designed or just arranged.

### Visual Composition

Look at the interface as a composition, not a collection of items.

**Color.** Count the distinct colors — not "there's blue" but how many blues, how many grays, how many accents. The number tells you something. Four colors working together is intention; twelve scattered around is fragmentation. Then ask: what's each color's job? Accent should mean action or emphasis. When it also means decoration, it stops meaning anything. Look for the relationships — are colors working as a family (analogous, complementary, monochromatic) or just coexisting?

**Type.** List the sizes and weights you see. A clear scale has distinct levels — you can point to the headline, the body, the metadata, the labels. A muddy scale has sizes so close they compete rather than complement. Look for one hero size that establishes importance. If everything's shouting, nothing is. The type stack is the skeleton of hierarchy; if it's not working, nothing else will save it.

**Depth.** What's the strategy — borders, shadows, surface tints, or flat? The question isn't which one, it's whether there's ONE approach applied consistently. Mixed strategies (shadows here, borders there, tints elsewhere) signal "assembled from different sources." When depth is intentional, elevation communicates hierarchy: modals float above cards, cards float above the base surface. When it's not, things just... sit there.

**Weight.** The heaviest visual elements — boldest color, largest type, strongest contrast — should match the most important content. This is where intention becomes visible. When a decorative gradient carries more visual weight than the primary action, the hierarchy is lying. Squint at the screen: does importance survive the blur?

### Interface Composition

Now look at the interface as a system of attention and flow.

**Entry point.** Where does your eye land first? There should be ONE clear answer. If attention bounces between the hero, the sidebar, the nav badges, and an inline CTA, nothing has claimed priority. The best interfaces are ruthless about this. Pick one reference this interface should sit next to — then describe what that reference does that this one doesn't.

**Density.** Is the amount of information appropriate for the context? A dashboard used daily can be dense — the user builds fluency. An onboarding screen should breathe — the user is orienting. Settings visited monthly should show the common case and hide the advanced. Density isn't good or bad; it's appropriate or not. Match it to expertise level and task frequency.

**Sequence.** If this takes more than one glance, what order do elements reveal themselves? A clear visual path guides the eye: headline → supporting text → action. A muddy path leaves the user to figure out the reading order on their own. Look at how groupings work — do they guide the sequence or interrupt it? Proximity and whitespace are doing choreography whether you intended it or not.

**Dead ends.** Are there elements that don't lead anywhere? Cards with no action, sections that exist but serve no purpose, information displayed with no next step. These are visual cul-de-sacs. Good interfaces always offer progressive disclosure — there's always somewhere to go next. If a user's attention lands on something, it should reward that attention.

### Interaction

This is where the interface becomes a conversation. Does it help the user do their job, or does it make them work around it? Does it speak their language or system language? Can they tell what's clickable? Do they know what state they're in?

**The Principles.** These are principles to hold while looking, not boxes to check. See [interaction.md](references/interaction.md) for the full framework. The short version:

- **Reversibility** — Can I undo what I just did? Confident users are users who can recover from mistakes.
- **Forgiveness** — Does it prevent errors before they happen? A disabled button during submission, a confirmation before delete.
- **Persistence** — Does my work survive? Refresh, navigation, network failure, closing the tab. Lost work is the deepest betrayal.
- **Transparency** — Do I know what's happening? Loading states, success confirmations, error explanations. Silent interfaces breed anxiety.
- **Escape** — Can I get out? Close the modal, cancel the flow, go back. Trapped users become angry users.
- **Consistency** — Does the same action work the same way everywhere? Or do patterns shift without reason?
- **Craft** — Are these intentional choices or unexamined defaults?
- **Recognition** — Are options visible, or do I have to remember them?

Not every principle applies to every interface. A static marketing page doesn't need Persistence. A checkout flow needs all of them. Use judgment.

**Scoring.** For each principle that applies, score 0-4 using the rubric in [interaction.md](references/interaction.md#scoring). The scores populate the Design Score table at the top of the output. Mark N/A for principles that don't apply (a static marketing page doesn't need Persistence) and adjust the total's denominator accordingly. The narrative finding per principle stays in this section — the score is the handle, the finding is the substance.

**Motion.** If there's animation, is it earning its place? Motion should clarify, not decorate. And users should never wait for an animation to finish before they can act.

### Craft & Technical

The details that separate "it works" from "someone cared." States, accessibility, polish — the craft layer beneath the design, plus the paper cuts that add up to an unfinished feel.

**Typography.** Read `references/typography.md` and apply the four-job framework inline:
- Orient: what context type is this? What's the primary reading task? Does the font fit the product's personality?
- Count: distinct sizes, weights, colors
- Audit each job (Hierarchy, Rhythm, Measure, Signal) — visual impression first, code flags after
- Score each 0–4 using the rubric in that file

Integrate typography findings into the Craft section prose. Don't produce a separate score table — that's what `/typeset` is for when a formal audit is needed.

For detailed technical checks, reference [checklists.md](references/checklists.md). The checklist covers interaction states (all five: default, hover, active, focus, disabled), data states (loading, empty, error), accessibility (keyboard navigation, focus visibility, semantics, contrast), motion constraints, and mobile considerations.

The craft lens isn't about checking boxes — it's about noticing whether the interface feels finished or feels like a prototype that shipped too early.

### Consistency

Does the interface feel like one designer made it, or like it was assembled from different kits?

**Pattern consistency.** Are similar actions handled the same way throughout? Delete works like delete everywhere? Modals all close the same way? When patterns shift without reason, users lose trust — they can't predict what will happen next.

**Platform conventions.** Does it follow established patterns for its platform — iOS, Android, web? Deviations aren't wrong, but they should be intentional improvements, not accidents. Users carry expectations from every other app they use.

**Component reuse.** Look for elements that should be the same component but aren't. Two card styles that are almost identical. Buttons that look different in different contexts. List items that change treatment between screens. These inconsistencies signal "no system."

**Visual language cohesion.** Step back and ask: does this feel unified? Same voice, same hand, same intention throughout? Or does it feel like three different designers worked on it without talking?

### Flow Coherence

_This lens applies when reviewing multiple screens or a sequence._

Flows have their own logic. Do the screens connect naturally — is the path obvious, or does the user have to figure out where they are? Does data persist across steps, or do they re-enter information? Do they know where they are in the process (step 2 of 4) and how much is left?

Look for escape routes. Can they abandon the flow at any point? Go back? What happens if something fails mid-flow — can they resume, or do they start over? What happens on refresh — does the URL deep-link to step 3, or does it dump them back at the beginning?

Good flows tell a story. There's a beginning (orientation), a middle (the work), and an end (completion, reward). Bad flows feel like a series of screens that happen to be connected.

## Output Format

```markdown
## Context

[1-2 sentences on what this is and who it's for. Name the user's state in one human sentence (rushed, anxious, skimming, committing). Name what getting this wrong costs — dollars, time, trust, safety, reputation. The cost line grounds every finding below.]

## Design Score

| # | Principle | Score | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Reversibility | ? | [short handle — one line] |
| 2 | Forgiveness | ? | [short handle] |
| 3 | Persistence | ? | [short handle] |
| 4 | Transparency | ? | [short handle] |
| 5 | Escape | ? | [short handle] |
| 6 | Consistency | ? | [short handle] |

**Total: X / Y — [Band]** (mark N/A where a principle doesn't apply; Y = applicable principles × 4)

Bands: ≥87% **Ship** · 68-86% **Polish** · 44-67% **Problems** · <44% **Blocked**

Scores are interpretive, not measured. Use them for trend-across-iterations, not absolute benchmarks. See [interaction.md](references/interaction.md#scoring) for the rubric.

## First Impressions

[1 paragraph. Gut reaction. What's the overall impression? Name the emotion the interface creates — not just "good" or "confusing" but the specific feeling: "quiet confidence," "overwhelming density," "polished but cold." What stands out? What feels off? Be direct and honest, not tentative. Describe the screen to someone who can't see it. The description is the critique. Before judgment, inventory.]

## Findings

Write each section as narrative prose with bolded issue names, not bulleted checklists. Lead with observation, then impact, then opportunity.

### Visual Composition

[Color, type, depth, weight distribution — analyzed as a composition, not a list of items. What's the color story? How does the type scale create hierarchy? Is there one depth strategy or several competing?]

### Interface Composition

[Entry point, density, sequence, dead ends. Where does the eye land? Is complexity revealed gradually? Are there visual cul-de-sacs? Do the same entities appear in multiple places with different mental models?]

### Interaction

[The principles — but only the ones that matter for this interface. For each relevant principle, give the score (0-4) and the finding underneath. Keep the narrative; the scores in the Design Score table above are the handles.]

### Craft

[States, accessibility, polish. The details that separate "it works" from "someone cared." Paper cuts — the small compounding issues (hover inconsistencies, redundant captions, UI debris) — live here.]

### Consistency

[Pattern consistency, platform conventions, component reuse, visual cohesion. Does it feel like one designer made this, or like it was assembled from different kits?]

## User Context

[Return to empathy. Answer these in prose, not bullets:]

- How does this interface make the user feel? Name the emotion precisely.
- What is the user's likely state of mind coming into this?
- Does the interface respect or ignore that state?
- Is the cost of getting this wrong visible enough to the user?

## Top Opportunities

[3-5 highest-impact changes, framed as openings. Each in one sentence, tied to affected principles where relevant.]

## Where this could go next

[What this interface could become. Two or three product directions, first-person and specific. "If I had one more day here, I'd…" Not polish-level suggestions — product-level proposals. Imagine the fuller version: what would this be doing if it fully honored the job it's hired to do?]

[Include file:line for code issues where relevant]
```

---

## Finding Format

Frame findings either as:

- **[Issue name]** — What's there. What it costs. What's better.
- **Opening:** [What could be better]. [What's there now]. [The gap].

Prefer door-opening framing. A finding framed as an opening invites action; a finding framed as a gap just documents one. "There's a reward moment waiting here" gets built; "progress feedback is missing" gets filed.

---

## On asserting absence

The skill can only see what's in the pixels. When a claim requires knowing something offscreen — autosave, brand system, keyboard shortcuts, parts of the flow not rendered here — frame the finding conditionally, not as fact.

✅ *"If this doesn't autosave, that's a Persistence gap."* — invites verification
❌ *"This doesn't autosave."* — overclaims from a static image

✅ *"If purple isn't a defined brand color, nine uses is fragmentation."* — respects possible intent
❌ *"Purple is monoculture."* — ignores brand-system reality

The first lands as a question worth answering. The second overclaims. When uncertain, hedge explicitly — Step 0 should have confirmed these where possible, but if it didn't, the finding itself names the conditional.

This matters for scoring too. Don't drop a principle score based on assumed absence. If you can't verify a behavior, either mark N/A or score based on what's visibly honored. A 2 should require actual pain, not assumed pain.

## For Specs & Plans

When the input is a spec, plan, or feature description (not an artifact), shift from critique to question-surfacing.

### Intent Questions (ask first)

Before interaction questions, establish intent:

- **Who is this human?** Not "users." The actual person. Where are they when they open this? What's on their mind?
- **What must they accomplish?** Not "use the feature." The verb. What action, what outcome?
- **What should this feel like?** Say it in words that mean something. "Clean and modern" means nothing. Warm like a notebook? Cold like a terminal? Dense like a trading floor? Calm like a reading app?

If the spec doesn't answer these with specifics, ask.

### Craft Questions

These decisions shape everything downstream. Surface them early:

- **Depth strategy:** Borders-only, subtle shadows, layered shadows, or surface color shifts? Pick ONE.
- **Typography:** What typeface fits the feel? Don't default — select.
- **Color temperature:** Warm, cool, neutral? What colors exist in this product's world?
- **Information density:** Spacious or dense? What serves the user's task?

### Interaction Questions

Work through each principle. Surface what's unaddressed:

**Reversibility:** Can users recover from mistakes? Undo, trash, version history?

**Forgiveness:** What happens on double-click? Bad input? Are destructive actions distinguishable from safe ones?

**Persistence:** What survives refresh? Navigation? API failure? Is there autosave?

**Transparency:** How will they know it worked? What does loading look like? What do errors show?

**Escape:** Can they cancel at any point? Close modals? Go back in flows?

**Consistency:** Does this work like similar actions elsewhere in the app? Platform conventions?

**Recognition:** Are options visible or must they remember them?

### Output Format for Specs

## Severity

Order findings by impact:

1. **Structural** — Information architecture, missing functionality, wrong mental model
2. **Behavioral** — How interface responds, flows, communicates
3. **Visual** — Color, type, spacing, shadows

Structural > Behavioral > Visual.

---

## Examples

**Visual Composition:**

> **Fragmented color story** — 14 distinct uses of purple across the page: navigation icons, card borders, badges, text highlights, gradients. Purple has become noise instead of signal. When everything is emphasized, nothing is. Pick 2-3 intentional uses and retire the rest.

**Interface Composition:**

> **No entry point** — Hero, sidebar promo, navigation badges, and inline CTA all compete at roughly equal visual weight. Nothing has claimed priority — attention has to pick a target. The hero is theoretically the entry, but the animated sidebar pulls just as hard. Pick one focal point and subordinate everything else.

**Density:**

> **Dashboard dense, user casual** — This is a settings page users visit once a month, but it's laid out like a trading terminal. 40+ controls visible at once. A monthly visitor needs progressive disclosure — show the common case, reveal advanced on demand.

**Emotional mismatch:**

> **Checkout anxiety ignored** — User is about to spend money. The interface shows a wall of small text, multiple upsells, and a "Place Order" button that's the same size as secondary actions. This is the moment for confidence and focus. Strip everything that isn't "here's what you're getting, here's what you're paying, here's how to complete." The user's anxiety is a design constraint.

**Interaction:**

> **Silent submit** — Button says "Save" but gives no feedback on click. User doesn't know if it worked. Add loading state during async, success confirmation after.

**Flow:**

> **Lost context on back** — User fills shipping address (step 2), clicks back to cart (step 1), returns — address fields empty. State not persisted across navigation.

**Paper cut:**

> **Hover inconsistency** — Primary buttons have hover states. Secondary buttons don't. Table rows are hoverable but don't show it until clicked. Small, but these add up to "unfinished."

**Consistency:**

> **Interaction patterns shift** — Primary actions use filled buttons, except on the settings page where they're outlined. Modals close with X in the corner, except the confirmation dialog which only has "Cancel" and "Confirm" buttons. Each inconsistency is small, but together they signal "assembled, not designed."

**User Context:**

> **How does this make the user feel?** Respect, but not excitement. There's no anxiety, no confusion — but also no pull. The interface is _correct_ without being _magnetic_.
>
> **What state are they in?** Evaluative. Scanning many portfolios, skeptical by default, ready to bounce. Looking for signal.
>
> **Does the interface respect that state?** It respects their time — scannable, fast, no friction. But it doesn't reward curiosity. For a portfolio where the goal is to make someone want to learn more, "calm competence" might not be enough. The user needs a reason to click.

**Where this could go next:**

> The form validation works. If I had one more day on this, here's where I'd take it:
>
> - A subtle progress indicator that grows as the form fills — the form stops feeling like a blocker and starts feeling like momentum
> - Smart defaults pre-filled from context or prior entries — the form does work *for* the user instead of asking them to do work
>
> Small moves. But they shift the form from "functional" to "someone thought about me" — which is also what separates a task from a product.
