# Interface Skills

Design critiques for the thing you're building. Code, screenshot, plan — whatever you've got.

For designers, engineers, PMs, anyone shipping software.

```bash
npx skills add alantippins/interface-skills
```

## The Problem

Interfaces ship with problems that feel obvious in retrospect. The user deleted something and couldn't get it back. They filled out a form, navigated away, came back. Form fields are empty. They clicked a button and couldn't tell if it worked.

---

## How It Works

Give it anything. It adapts.

| Input            | Output                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Code             | Critique the implementation   |
| Screenshot       | Critique the visual           |
| Spec or plan     | Surface unaddressed questions |
| Multiple screens | Add flow coherence            |

```
/interface-skills
```

No modes to remember. Run it against whatever you're working on.

If you give it a screenshot with no other context, it'll ask one question first — *what is this and what does it do?* — before critiquing. Skip the question by giving context up front.

## The Principles

**Reversibility.** Can users undo what they just did? Confident users can recover from mistakes. When delete is permanent, users hesitate. When undo exists, they explore.

**Forgiveness.** Does the interface prevent errors before they happen? A disabled button during submission stops the double-click. A confirmation before delete catches the misclick. Forgiveness assumes mistakes and catches them.

**Persistence.** Does work survive refresh, navigation, network failure, closing the tab? Lose someone's work once and they remember it forever.

**Transparency.** Do users know what's happening? Loading states, success confirmations, error explanations. Silent interfaces feel broken. I click, nothing changes — did it work? Is it broken? Am I supposed to wait?

**Escape.** Can users get out? Close the modal, cancel the flow, go back. Every state needs an exit.

**Consistency.** Does the same action work the same way everywhere? When patterns shift without reason, users stop predicting what's next.

**Craft.** Are these intentional choices or unexamined defaults? The difference shows. Craft is visible in the details — the hover state that exists, the spacing that breathes, the animation that clarifies rather than decorates.

**Recognition.** Are options visible, or must users remember them? Humans are better at recognizing than recalling. Show them what they can do.

---

## The Lenses

Different ways of seeing the same interface. Not every lens applies to every screen. The skill uses judgement.

**Visual Composition.** Look at color, typography, depth, and weight as a composition, not a collection of items. Count the distinct colors. List the type sizes. Is there one depth strategy, or several competing? The squint test — does importance survive the blur?

**Interface Composition.** Where does the eye land first? Is there one clear entry point, or does everything compete for attention? Is the density appropriate for who's using this and how often? Are there dead ends — elements that exist but lead nowhere?

**Interaction.** This is where the principles live. Does the interface help the user do their job, or make them work around it? Can they tell what's clickable? Do they know what state they're in?

**Craft.** The technical quality users feel even when they can't name it. Interaction states (default, hover, active, focus, disabled). Data states (loading, empty, error). Accessibility. The polish that separates "it works" from "someone cared."

**Consistency.** Does the interface feel like one designer made it, or like it was assembled from different kits? Are similar actions handled the same way throughout? Do patterns shift without reason?

## Examples

### On Code

```
> /interface-skills src/components/Settings.tsx

## Context
Settings page for a B2B SaaS product. Monthly visitors, not daily.

## What I'm seeing
Dense. Forty-plus controls visible at once, and the monthly-visitor pattern
doesn't justify that density. The interface is laid out like a trading
terminal for someone who's actually a casual dropper-in. That mismatch is
the loudest thing on the screen, and it's paying interest on every other
finding below.

Zoom past the density and the smaller stuff starts showing up. Seven
distinct grays across cards, borders, dividers. A save button that clicks
into silence. Form state that doesn't survive a sidebar tap. Stacked,
they're the "assembled rather than designed" feeling you can feel before
you can name. The shape is right — this isn't a rethink, it's a polish
pass with one scope cut.

## Findings

### Interaction
**Transparency** — Save button gives no feedback. User clicks, nothing
visible happens. Did it work? Add loading state during async, success
confirmation after.

**Persistence** — Form state doesn't survive navigation. User fills fields,
clicks a link in the sidebar to check something, comes back — fields empty.

### Visual Composition
**Color fragmentation** — Seven distinct grays across the page: card
backgrounds, borders, text, dividers. Close enough to feel accidental
rather than systematic. Three grays would do the job.

## Top Opportunities
1. Progressive disclosure — show common settings, hide advanced
2. Add save feedback (loading → success)
3. Persist form state across navigation

## High Craft
A settings page that remembers you. When monthly visitors come back, the
section they touched last time is quietly expanded — "you were here last" —
so they rebuild context in two seconds instead of scanning from scratch.
Pair that with save feedback that summarizes what actually changed
("billing contact changed to Jenna Cho") and the page picks up a
personality.

## Closing question
What did I miss or get wrong?
```

### On a Plan

```
> /interface-skills [run against your Claude Code plan]

## Delete Button

### Questions

**Reversibility:**
- Should deleted items go to trash (recoverable) or permanent delete?
- Confirmation dialog, undo toast, or both?

**Transparency:**
- What feedback after deletion? Toast? Animation? Optimistic removal?

**Consistency:**
- How do other destructive actions work in this app? Match the pattern.

### Suggestions

If you want safe defaults: soft delete with 30-day recovery, confirmation
dialog for single items, undo toast for bulk operations.
```

Add `--teach` to include principle explanations with each finding.

## Severity

When technical issues appear:

- 🔴 **Blocker** — Data loss, no escape, accessibility blockers
- 🟡 **Warning** — Missing safeguards, craft issues with workarounds
- 🟢 **Suggestion** — Polish opportunities, minor consistency issues

## Foundation

The methodology lives in `critique.md`. Deep-dive references in `references/`:

- **interaction.md** — Principles of interface quality
- **checklists.md** — Technical checks (states, accessibility, mobile, red flags)
