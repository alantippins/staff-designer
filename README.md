# Interface Skills

A suite of two skills for reviewing and improving interface quality. One command installs both.

```bash
npx skills add alantippins/staff-designer
```

| Skill | Command | What it does |
| ----- | ------- | ------------ |
| Staff Designer | `/staff-designer` | Holistic interface critique — 8 principles, Design Score, writerly findings |
| Typeset | `/typeset` | Formal typography audit — four-job scoring, code flags, generative directions |

Staff Designer applies typography analysis inline during every critique. Run `/typeset` when you want the full standalone audit with a score table and code-level flags.

---

## The Problem

Interfaces ship with problems that feel obvious in retrospect. The user deleted something and couldn't get it back. They filled out a form, navigated away, came back. Form fields are empty. They clicked a button and nothing happened. No feedback, no confirmation.

---

## How It Works

Give it anything. It adapts.

| Input            | Output                        |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Code             | Critique the implementation   |
| Screenshot       | Critique the visual           |
| Spec or plan     | Surface unaddressed questions |
| Multiple screens | Add flow coherence            |

```
/staff-designer
```

No modes to remember. Just run it against whatever you're working on.

Output opens with a **Design Score**. 8 principles graded 0 to 4, with a total and a band: Ship, Polish, Problems, or Blocked. Scan the score to track across iterations. Read the narrative to understand why.

## The Principles

Principles to reference while looking at an interface.

Based on Nielsen's usability heuristics and Laws of UX. These eight are the ones that fire when someone actually touches the interface. Craft is the intentionality lens.

**Reversibility.** Can users undo what they just did? Confident users are users who can recover from mistakes. When delete is permanent, users hesitate. When undo exists, they explore.

**Forgiveness.** Does the interface prevent errors before they happen? A disabled button during submission stops the double-click. A confirmation before delete catches the misclick. Forgiveness assumes humans make mistakes and designs around that fact.

**Persistence.** Does work survive? Refresh, navigation, network failure, closing the tab. Lost work is the deepest betrayal an interface can commit. Users remember the time they lost twenty minutes of writing forever.

**Transparency.** Do users know what's happening? Loading states, success confirmations, error explanations. Silent interfaces breed anxiety. When I click and nothing changes, did it work? Is it broken? Am I supposed to wait?

**Escape.** Can users get out? Close the modal, cancel the flow, go back. Trapped users become frustrated users. Every state should have an exit.

**Consistency.** Does the same action work the same way everywhere? When patterns shift without reason, users lose trust. They stop predicting what will happen next.

**Craft.** Are these intentional choices or unexamined defaults? The difference shows. Craft is visible in the details — the hover state that exists, the spacing that breathes, the animation that clarifies rather than decorates.

**Recognition.** Are options visible, or must users remember them? Humans are better at recognizing than recalling. Show them what they can do.

---

## The Lenses

Different ways of seeing the same interface. Not every lens applies to every screen. The skill uses judgement.

**Visual Composition.** Look at color, typography, depth, and weight as a composition, not a collection of items. Count the distinct colors. List the type sizes. Ask: is there one depth strategy or several competing? The squint test — does importance survive the blur?

**Interface Composition.** Where does the eye land first? Is there one clear entry point, or does everything compete for attention? Is the density appropriate for who's using this and how often? Are there dead ends — elements that exist but lead nowhere?

**Interaction.** This is where the principles live. Does the interface help the user do their job, or make them work around it? Can they tell what's clickable? Do they know what state they're in?

**Craft.** The layer beneath the design. Interaction states (default, hover, active, focus, disabled). Data states (loading, empty, error). Accessibility. The polish that separates "it works" from "someone cared."

**Consistency.** Does the interface feel like one designer made it, or like it was assembled from different kits? Are similar actions handled the same way throughout? Do patterns shift without reason?

## Examples

### On Code

```
> /staff-designer src/components/Settings.tsx

## Context
Settings page for a B2B SaaS product. Users visit monthly, not daily.

## First Impressions
Dense. 40+ controls visible at once, but users only touch 2-3 per visit.
The density says "power tool" but the audience is casual visitors.

## Findings

### Visual Composition
**Color fragmentation** — Seven distinct grays across the page: card backgrounds,
borders, text, dividers. They're close enough to feel accidental rather than
systematic. Three grays would do the job.

### Interaction
**Transparency** — Save button gives no feedback. User clicks, nothing visible
happens. Did it work? Add loading state during async, success confirmation after.

**Persistence** — Form state doesn't survive navigation. User fills fields,
clicks a link in the sidebar to check something, comes back — fields empty.

## Top Opportunities
1. Add save feedback (loading → success)
2. Persist form state across navigation
3. Progressive disclosure — show common settings, hide advanced
```

### On a Plan

```
> /staff-designer [run against your Claude Code plan]

## Delete Button

### Questions

**Reversibility:**
- Should deleted items go to trash (recoverable) or permanent delete?
- Confirmation dialog, undo toast, or both?

**Transparency:**
- What feedback after deletion? Toast? Animation? Optimistic removal?

**Consistency:**
- How do other destructive actions work in this app? Match the pattern.

### Suggestions

If you want safe defaults: soft delete with 30-day recovery, confirmation
dialog for single items, undo toast for bulk operations.
```

Add `--teach` to include principle explanations with each finding.

## How to use it

Run it. Fix what's worth fixing. Run it again.

The skill will always find something. Design critique is continuous. It won't go quiet on its own and tell you you're done.

Three signals to watch for:

**The Design Score stops moving.** Two or three runs land at the same band, numbers barely shift. That's the plateau. Progress has stopped — you're polishing inside a local maximum.

**Findings shift from diagnostic to generative.** Early runs surface what's broken — silent submits, lost state, bad hierarchy. Later runs shift to what this could become — reimagined flows, product-level proposals. When the diagnostic findings go quiet and "Where this could go next" is the only section producing new material, you've hit the floor. The next move is a redesign, not another polish pass.

**Top Opportunities become taste, not fixes.** "Tighten the type scale" is taste. "Users can't recover from mistakes" is a fix. When you're only getting the former, ship.

This skill is another pair of eyes for your designs. It'll always find something worth naming. Go with your gut when you feel you're ready.

## Severity

When technical issues appear:

- 🔴 **Blocker** — Data loss, no escape, accessibility blockers
- 🟡 **Warning** — Missing safeguards, craft issues with workarounds
- 🟢 **Suggestion** — Polish opportunities, minor consistency issues

---

## Foundation

The methodology lives in `critique.md`. Deep-dive references in `references/`:

- **interaction.md** — Principles of interface quality
- **checklists.md** — Technical checks (states, accessibility, mobile, red flags)

```bash
npx skills add alantippins/staff-designer
```

One command installs the full suite. To install a single skill: `npx skills add alantippins/staff-designer@typeset`
